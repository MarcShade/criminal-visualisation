# Crime Statistics
This is a school assignment in programming on data visualization. We decided to make a world heat map on Interpols red notice list, which can be accessed since it's a public API.

The data recieved from Interpol is a huge json-file with multiple "pages". 

This stack-overflow page will come in handy at some point:

## How it's made
**Tech used:** Python, Matplotlib, cartopy

~~Use ```git clone https://github.com/MarcShade/criminal-visualisation```, install the necessary dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, and press run to run the program.~~ Project is still a WIP.

## Expectations
In this project, we expect to learn the intricacies of both Matplotlib and the cartopy libraries, as we have never worked with them before. Furthermore we expect to improve our understanding of development environments e.g. modules and packages.

The last data visualization project was made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so we expect to get a much better result in the context of actually visualizing the data, but a much uglier UI.
